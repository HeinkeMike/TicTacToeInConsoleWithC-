# Readme
Just my simple TicTacToe in C++ for the cmd.
Approximate working time: 4 Hours
Main issues:
* got a little bit lazy at the end, and messed the main-method up
* No test cases 
* Just a few minutes of testing
* Little to no prior thoughts about the checkStateOfGame-method, guess the efficiency could be improved a lot.

If you stare at this messed up code and want to refactor it, go for it.
And please push the changes afterwards.
